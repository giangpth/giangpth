- 👋 Hi, I’m @giangpth. 
- 👀 I’m interested in computational biology, bioinformatics and big data (especially some approximation algorithms)  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about biology and how to use computer science to solve biology problems and also algorithms. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computational biology and also apply machine learning in biology. Besides, I am also interested in algorithms so anything about algorithm.
